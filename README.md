# abstract
here are all the sunvox modules i've made. they are sorted based on sunvox's own module library. this commit also contains documentation and notes for each module

to get the modules, simply clone this repo, move the archive to sunvox's root directory, and tell your file manager to merge the directories

these require (as of now) the latest sunvox version, 2.0 beta, for the controller colors and extra controllers. idk what happens if you try to load these in sunvox 1.9.6c or lower

feel free to report bugs with the modules or documentation or even request new ones in the issue tracker :>
