- wet: the gain of the wet signal. 128 (1000) = -6db

## group 2: main controls

- depth: the depth of the chorus effect
- rate: the rate of the chorus effect

## group 3: delay

- delay l: the delay time on the left channel
- delay r: the delay time on the right channel
- delay volume l: the volume of the delayed left channel
- delay volume r: the volume of the delayed right channel
- delay inverse: whether the right channel is inverted
- delay unit: the unit of the delay

## group 4: post
