# abstract

a pitch shifter that works independently on each channel, with dry/wet mixing

can be used to create cool stereo effects

# controllers

## group 1: dry/wet settings

- left dry: the gain of the dry signal on the left channel, 128 (1000) = -6db
- left wet: the gain of the wet signal on the left channel, 128 (1000) = -6db
- right dry: the gain of the dry signal on the right channel, 128 (1000) = -6db
- right wet: the gain of the wet signal on the right channel, 128 (1000) = -6db

## group 2: pitch shifter main settings

- left shift: the pitch shift of the left channel, in semitones/10 * the pitch scale
- right shift: the pitch shift of the right channel, in semitones/10 * the pitch scale

## group 3: pitch shifter scale settings

- left pitch scale: the pitch scale percentage of the left channel
- right pitch scale: the pitch scale percentage of the right channel

## group 4: pitch shifter grain settings

- left grain size: the grain size of the left channel
- right grain size: the grain size of the right channel
