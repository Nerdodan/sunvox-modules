#abstract

a formant filter based on the "talkwah" effect from native instruments's fm8

along with the vowel and size controllers, this module has the additional controllers of dry/wet and wet signal distortion (hard clipping)

the multictl curves were drawn by hand

use it to make your dubstep basses more organic and monstrous

#controllers

##group 1: dry/wet settings

- dry: the gain of the dry signal, 128 (1000) = -6db
- wet: the gain of the wet signal, 128 (1000) = -6db

##group 2: main settings

- vowel: the vowel of the formant filter. ranges from ooo <-> aaa <-> eee
- size: the size of the vocal cavity. larger values make the cavity larger and the pitch deeper

##group 3: additional settings

- distortion: the distortion power (gain) of the wet signal. this was necessary since the raw wet signal is kind of quiet
