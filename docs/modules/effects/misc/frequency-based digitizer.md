#abstract

a type of digitization (sample rate reduction) where the sample rate is keytracked to the frequency of the note

use it to ensure that aliasing harmonics scale with the note pitch

#controllers

##group 1: digitization settings

- digitization: the amount of digitization to apply. note that even at 0, there is still some reduction in the bass notes
- input transpose: the transposition of the input pitch in semitones

##group 2: additonal settings

- bit depth: the bit depth of the signal, for additonal digitization effects
