#abstract

a clone of the sausage fattener plugin by dada life, widely used in electronic dance music. pls don't sue me

it is essentially a hard clipper with a high shelf boost in the high end

use it as an easy way to saturate your sounds and make them, well, fatter

i don't like phallic things that much hence why this is called just the fattener
