# abstract

a simple saturator

use it to make your sounds beefier and sit better in the mix

for harder distortion effects, please see my overdrive module

the functionality of this module is built into my bus pro module

the waveshaper curves were generated using pixilang, i'll see if i can find the original file

- odd/even harmonics: the mix of the symmetrical/asymmetrical saturators
- character: the curve shape of the saturator
- mix: the dry/wet mix of the saturation. 16384 (4000) = 50% dry 50% wet
