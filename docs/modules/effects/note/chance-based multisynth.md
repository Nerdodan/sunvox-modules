#abstract

a simple module that allows a note signal to pass through based on a chance and seed

i needed this for a module i'm working on rn, stay tuned

#controllers

##group 1: settings

- chance: the static chance for the note signal to pass through. 16384 (4000) = 50%
- seed: the seed for the chance. you would probably change this using a noise signal or a multictl with a noise curve
