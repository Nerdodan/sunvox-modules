# abstract

a six filter stereo parametric eq. can be used for left/right and mid/side processing

when stereo mode is enabled, bands 1-3 are used for the left channel/the mids, and bands 4-3 are used for the right channel/the sides

useful for anything related to equalization, though a simple set of filter pro modules are recommended for economical processing, since using this module for that purpose would be wasteful

- 1 freq: the filter frequency of this band in hertz
- 1 bandwidth: the resonance (bandwidth) of this band
- 1 roll-off: the roll-off of this band in db/oct
- 1 gain: the filter gain of this band. only applies to peak, low shelf, and high shelf filters

## group 3: band 2

- 2 type: the filter type of this band
- 2 freq: the filter frequency of this band in hertz
- 2 bandwidth: the resonance (bandwidth) of this band

## group 8: stereo mode controls

- stereo mode: enables stereo processing
- lr/ms: switches between left-right processing and mid-side processing
