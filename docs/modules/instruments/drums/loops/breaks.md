# abstract

a set of drum loops using various versions of my acoustic drum modules. they are at various tempos in the style of funk/soul, whose most famous breaks have been sampled in genres like hip-hop and jungle

most of these are my original creatons, though a few are made to replicate famous drum breaks

here are the breaks in alphabetical order:

- armageddon (original)
- bounce (original)
- brick (original)
- chase (original)
- dmxbend (original)
- driver (original)
- flam (original)
- flow (original)
- funkpute (original)
- gangassimilate (david bowie - join the gang)
- gohard (original)
- grinder (original)
- pseudoamen (the winstons - amen, brother)
- pseudothink (lyn collins - think (about it))
- pure (original)
- setup (original)
- stoplight (original)

set the input module to 256 to simply play the breaks, or set the input module to 1 to play the individual drum sounds using the keyboard keys. the drum sounds start on c0 and go kick - snare - hihat/ride - crash - misc perc (shakers, etc)

sample these and slice them up to make sick grooves without murky legal implications or unoriginality or stealing royalties

## controllers

the controllers are similar for each break, though they can vary a bit depending on the drums breaks

group 1 is the mix for each drum sound, in terms of the peak value. 16384 (4000) = -6db

groups 2 and beyond are the seeds/phases for each drum sound. i may add more customization options in the future
