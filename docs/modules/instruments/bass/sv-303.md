# abstract

a clone of the (in)famous roland tb-303 synth, used in countless acid tunes

designed to mimic the sound and controls of the original synth, minus the sequencer

sounds amazing with my overdrive module, though you can use it dry if you just want some funky basslines

# controllers

## group 1: back controls

- waveform: switches between a sawtooth and an imperfect square wave for the oscillator

## group 2: main controls

- tuning: the tuning of the oscillator in semitones/50. has a range of +/- 1 octave
- cutoff: the exponential cutoff of the 24db lowpass filter
- resonance: the resonance of the 24db lowpass filter
- env mod: the amount of envelope to apply to the filter cutoff
- decay: the decay of the filter envelope
- accent amount: the amount of accent when it is enabled, which adds a quick upwards sweep on the cutoff and resonance

## group 3: sequenced controls

- slide: adds slide (portamento) to the notes. intended to be switched on and off during the sequence
- accent: adds accent to the notes. intended to be switched on and off during the sequence
