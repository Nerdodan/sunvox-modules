a module simulating the infamous [mosquito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito) device, because why not?

~~great for keeping those kids off your lawn~~

this does not use note input, simply flick the "enable" controller and connect it to the output, it will generate the sound on its own

#controllers

##group 1: main controls

- enable: enables the sound output
- mode: switches between 17.4 khz and 8 khz for the tone
