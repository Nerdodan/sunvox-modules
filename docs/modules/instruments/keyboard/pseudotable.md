#abstract

a monophonic pseudo-wavetable oscillator with a sine wave rm/pm modulator, in the style of native instruments's massive

the two waveforms are created using a generator sawtooth send into a waveshaper, where the waveform can be drawn by hand or generated by pixilang

as of now, you'll have to go inside the metamodules to edit the waveforms, but this could change in the future

the wavetable function is simply a crossfader between the two waveforms

#controllers

##group 1: wavetable controls

- wave mix: the crossfade between the two waveforms

##group 2: modulator controls

- mod osc transpose: the transposition of the modulator from the input pitch in semitones
- mod osc finetune: the transposition of the modulator from the input pitch in semitones/256
- pm amount: the amount of phase modulation on the wavetable
- rm amount: the amount of ring modulation on the wavetable

##group 3: envelope main controls

- attack: the attack of the amplitude envelope in milliseconds
- decay: the decay of the amplitude envelope in milliseconds
- sustain: the sustain mode of the amplitude envelope
- sustain level: the sustain level of the amplitude envelope
- release: the release of the amplitude envelope in milliseconds

##group 4: envelope curve controls

- attack curve: the curve shape for the attack stage of the amp envelope
- decay curve: the curve shape for the decay stage of the amp envelope
- release curve: the curve shape for the release stage of the amp envelope

##group 5: envelope other controls

- sustain pedal: enables the sustain pedal of the amp envelope
